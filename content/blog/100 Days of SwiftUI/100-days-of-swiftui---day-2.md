## Day 2
### 100 Days of SwiftUI

I made it two days. ðŸ˜€  Not quite to making it a habit.

Today it the lesson was all about [complex data types](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/2). This is review for me so far but it has been good to take a little bit of time to make sure I understand the fundementals.  One thing I did learn was how to provide a default value for dictionaries.  I can not remember a time I had to use this or if I did need it I did not realize I could have used default value.

```swift
let favoriteColor = [
    "Hannah": "pink",
    "Emmalynne": "purple",
    "Royce": "blue"
]

favoriteColor["Dad", default:  "Unknown"]
```

The tests that Paul Hudson provides are great to help renforce the learning for the day. I will watch the videos, read the lessons and play with the code in Playgrounds.  Later in the day, I will take the tests to ensure that I understand the content.
