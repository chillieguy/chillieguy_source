## Day 1
### 100 Days of SwiftUI

Today marks the 100 days until the end of the year.  This will be the journal of my adventure.  

While I have some experience with Swift and iOS development I believe that following the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) will provide a good review of the fundamentals while learning about Apples new SwiftUI framework.

[Day One](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/1) was a review of variables and constants.  Tests are provided to make sure you understand the lessons for the day.
