## The Adventure Begins

This will be my little corner of the internet to chronicle my journey.

At first I will be using this blog to talk about the last 100 days of 2019 while I follow Paul Hudsons [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). If you are looking to join the 100 Days of Code Challenge Paul has created a framework to help you learn Swift, SwiftUI and most importantly keep you on track.
