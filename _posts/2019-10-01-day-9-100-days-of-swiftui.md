## Day 9
### 100 Days of SwiftUI

Rewatched the videos from [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) Day 8 and Day 9.

Also spent some time reading the Swift documentation for [Classes and Structures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ClassesAndStructures.html).

Structures are Value Types.  A value type is a type whose value is copied when it’s assigned to a variable or constant, or when it’s passed to a function.

Paul Hudson touched on this in the videos. From the offical documentation.
```
You’ve actually been using value types extensively throughout the previous chapters. In fact, all of the basic types in Swift—integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, strings, arrays and dictionaries—are value types, and are implemented as structures behind the scenes.
```

Tomorrow is Classes so I will compare and contrast some of the differences.
