## Day 7
### 100 Days of SwiftUI

Second day of Closures.  [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) finished up Closures with more advanced topics.  Along with the videos and tests I also used the below resources to help grow my understanding of Closures.

I used Swift documentation for [Closures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html).  There is more indepth coverage with code examples.  The Swift documentation is always a good resource to review or learn a new topic.

[How Do You Write Closures in Swift?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVF_tNcIhfc) from Brian Voong from [Lets Build That App](https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/) is a great resource with his free content on his website and his paid courses.
